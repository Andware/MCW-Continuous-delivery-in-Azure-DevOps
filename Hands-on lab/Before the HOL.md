# Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this lab, you will configure a developer environment and download the required files for this course if you do not already have one that meets the requirements.

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Azure subscription <http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/>

### Task 1: Use Azure Shell as your development environment

>**Note**: This workshop *can* be completed using only the Azure Cloud Shell.   However, if you are a developer you should take the opportunity to use your local setup to perform the exercises. 

We have [a guide for local setup of the Azure CLI you can use ](http://hermit.no/how-to-setup-azure-cli-for-use-with-bash-shell-in-windows/).  

If you don't have Git installed locally, it can be [downloaded and installed from here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

1.  In a web browser, navigate to https://shell.azure.com. Alternatively, from the Azure web portal, launch the **Azure Cloud Shell**. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

    ![This is a screenshot of a icon used to launch the Azure Cloud Shell from the Azure Portal.](images/Setup/image3.png "Azure Cloud Shell launch icon")

2.  From inside the Azure Cloud Shell (or Azure CLI locally) type these commands to configure Git:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "<your name>"
    ```

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email <your email>
    ```

3. If you run locally, you should login to Azure using the Azure CLI

    ```
    az login
    ```

4. Locally you can use a Visual Studio developer command shell, or you can use the Git Bash shell.  

    Using Windows search, you can find either of these, searching for either 'developer' or 'bash'.

    Whenever the text below, or in the Hands On Lab refers to Azure Cloud Shell, you should use the Bash shell with Azure CLI.  (For most of the commands, you can use either (Dev Cmd or Bash) but when executing the script to upload the ARM template, you must use Bash.)  

    Note that if you didn't set up the alias shown in point 3 in the [guide](http://hermit.no/how-to-setup-azure-cli-for-use-with-bash-shell-in-windows/), then you must use the full name of the CLI like_

    ```
    az.cmd login
    ```
>**Note**: Using the Azure Cloud Shell, you
 can load the integrated code editor (Cloud Shell Editor) at any time with the following command:
```bash
code .
```

You should follow all steps provided *before* starting the Hands-on Lab.
